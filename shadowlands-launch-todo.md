# Shadowlands Launch TODO

## **As of level 54 in beta**

## Adjust graphics

* Set the target framerate setting to what you want
* View Distance, Environment Detail, Ground Clutter
    - Significant performance impact at 10 vs 7
* Adjust new Spell Density setting for your preferences

## Prepare your inventory

### What happens to Azerite

* All powers are disabled
* No secondary stats are added
* Item budget is poor until you get replacements in Shadowlands
* Which all means that you should keep your highest iLvl Azerite and get rid of the rest

### What happens to the neck

* It remains as a high iLvl piece of gear
* Retains three secondary stats
* Excellent item budget all the way through in Shadowlands (At 59, still much better than rewards)

### What happens to the cloak

* It remains as a high iLvl piece of gear
* Retains three secondary stats
* Excellent item budget all the way through to about 58 in Shadowlands

### What happens to corruption

* It deactivates but is still visible on the item
* No longer adds corruption
* Total corruption no longer exists

### What gear to keep

* Trinkets with procs
    - Terrible quest rewards in Shadowlands for trinkets
    - Some procs remain powerful
* Highest iLvl pieces
    - Socketed pieces may push an item way higher

### How do gems scale

* Main stat gem = 18
* Secondary stat gem = 7
* Gems can keep an item useful for several iLvls above what it is worth
* iLvl 80 (420) bracers give 12 main stat for perspective

### Bank

* Clear out your bank, but keep:
    - Potions, Flasks, Food, Runes, Goblin Gliders, Talent Tree Tomes
        - Use while leveling
    - Gems
        - Socket into gear that you get while leveling
* Clear out reagent bank

## Professions

* [Ultimate Gnomish Army Knife](https://www.wowhead.com/item=109253/ultimate-gnomish-army-knife)
    - For miners, herbalists, and skinners
    - Gathering professions give petals, etc this expansion, so this will help you gather better things faster
    - Can be bought from the auction house, sits in inventory

## Leveling Plan

* Replacing Azerite
    * Take chest reward when offered
    * Take shoulder reward when offered
    * Helm rewards are more common
* Weapons seem scarce
* Make sure you have legendary cloak as cloak rewards don't happen in first zone
* Macro pickpocket into abilities while leveling - rewarding 3-6g per mob

### Bastion

* Instance at the end is not required to move to the next zone
* Should be able to get Loremaster without much deviation, with few side quests

### Maldraxxus

* Quite a few skippable side quests
* Should be able to get Loremaster without much deviation, with few side quests

### Ardenweald

* Quite a few skippable side quests
* Requires deviation from mission quests to get Loremaster

### Revendreth

* TBD
