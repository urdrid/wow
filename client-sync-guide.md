Guide to Syncing World of Warcraft Settings Across Devices

Purpose
To have addon and addon settings sync from one device to others. This avoid setting up a UI on multiple computers and keeps your playing experience consistent no matter what device you're on!

What folders are we syncing?
Interface/Addons
This folder contains any addons that you've installed yourself or from clients like the Twitch client. Syncing this to another device will retain a consistent set of addons across all devices.

WTF/Account
This folder contains saved account setting information for the WoW installation on your current device. Syncing this to another device will bring across your addon settings and other important saved information.

What tools will I need to sync the settings?
A sync client, such as Dropbox, OneDrive, or similar. I use OneDrive.

How do we sync the folders?


FAQ
What about Mac?
You should be able to perform the same steps in this guide, replacing the symbolic link steps from Windows with the equivalent "ln" command on a Mac.

What about pixel-perfect UI element placement?
You may see some UI elements that look out of place if you are syncing setups that run at different resolutions. I personally sync 1440p to 1080p without issue.

What about my keybindings?
Keybindings are stored as part of the character variables that are sent to the WoW servers, which are automatically synced as part of your default game installation.

What is not synced?
Settings that are controlled by the client such as sound and graphics settings. Different computers need different settings for these, so this is an item that thankfully does not sync!
